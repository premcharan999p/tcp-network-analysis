TCP Performance Analysis Summary
===============================

1. Throughput Analysis
---------------------
The analysis of throughput data across different TCP variants and network types reveals:

LAN Network:
- Best performing: Cubic with average throughput of 81.36 Mbps
- Tahoe: Avg=45.34 Mbps, Max=89.42 Mbps, Min=9.53 Mbps, Std Dev=30.55 Mbps
- Reno: Avg=67.89 Mbps, Max=95.13 Mbps, Min=9.90 Mbps, Std Dev=32.87 Mbps
- Cubic: Avg=81.36 Mbps, Max=98.10 Mbps, Min=37.17 Mbps, Std Dev=16.96 Mbps

WLAN Network:

2. Stability and Fairness Analysis
--------------------------------
The analysis of stability (coefficient of variation) and fairness (Jain's Fairness Index) reveals:

LAN Network:
- Most stable: Cubic with CV of 0.2084
- Fairest: Cubic with JFI of 0.9597
- Tahoe: CV=0.6738 (lower is better), JFI=0.6950 (higher is better)
- Reno: CV=0.4842 (lower is better), JFI=0.8153 (higher is better)
- Cubic: CV=0.2084 (lower is better), JFI=0.9597 (higher is better)

WLAN Network:
Error reading stability statistics: single positional indexer is out-of-bounds

3. Network Impact Analysis
-------------------------
The analysis of the impact of network type (LAN vs. WLAN) on TCP performance reveals:

- Most resilient to network change: Tahoe with 45.77% performance decrease

- Tahoe: LAN=45.34 Mbps, WLAN=24.59 Mbps, Decrease=45.77%
- Reno: LAN=67.89 Mbps, WLAN=24.26 Mbps, Decrease=64.27%
- Cubic: LAN=81.36 Mbps, WLAN=26.05 Mbps, Decrease=67.98%

4. Overall Conclusions
---------------------
Based on the comprehensive analysis of throughput, stability, fairness, and network resilience, TCP Cubic appears to be the best overall performer in our test scenarios.

Overall scores (higher is better):
- TCP Cubic: 11 points
- TCP Reno: 10 points
- TCP Tahoe: 9 points
